# Background

According to industry leaders such as Imran Bashir and others, Blockchain technologies including Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has enormous potential and is about to really take off and [become mainstream](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/083115/blockchain-technology-revolutionize-traditional-banking.asp). In 'Mastering Blockchain', Bashir states that by 2025 it is expected that by 2025 the technology will be mature enough to be used very regularly by regular, less tech-savvy consumers. 

One step in that journey is the decision by the Australian Securities Exchanges (ASX) to replace their legacy clearing and settlement system with [Blockchain Technology](https://www.afr.com/chanticleer/asx-s-make-or-break-tech-project-20220121-p59q8c).

Bashir refers to this website, [DeFi Pulse](https://www.defipulse.com/), as an indication of this sector's growth. At the moment in January 2022 it shows a total of $ 79 billion US Dollars locked in the system, up from the $ 5 billion he referenced in 'Mastering Blockchain' (published in 2020). 

This app is a limited example of such a consumer interface.

# Acknowledgements

I would like to first acknowledge the guidance and teaching of our FinTech Boot Camp Instructor, Garth Mortensen, our Teaching Assistant Roberto Salazar, our Student Success Manager, Angelica Baraona; and the whole team. I also found the collective Stack Overflow wisdom and Investopedia reference essential as ever. For Python class knowledge itself, I really liked 'Python Crash Course' by Eric Matthes. My other main resource specifically on this projects' coding was 'Mastering Blockchain - Unlocking the Power of Cryptocurrencies, Smart Contracts, and Decentralized Applications' by Lorne Lantz and Daniel Cawrey (O'Reilly); 'Blockchain and Distributed Ledgers - Mathematics, Technology and Economics' by Alexander Lipton and Adrien Treccani (World Scientific); and 'Mastering Blockchain - A deep dive into distributed ledgers, consensus protocols, smart contracts, DApps, cryptocurrencies, Ethereum, and more' by Imran Bashir (Packt). Also I found helpful the cheat sheet from [Intelliplaat](https://intellipaat.com/blog/tutorial/blockchain-tutorial/blockchain-cheat-sheet/). The [crash course](http://adilmoujahid.com/posts/2018/03/intro-blockchain-bitcoin-python/) on Adil Moujahid's page was great.
