# Acknowledgements

I would like to first acknowledge the guidance and teaching of our FinTech Boot Camp Instructor, Garth Mortensen, our Teaching Assistant Roberto Salazar, our Student Success Manager, Angelica Baraona; and the whole team. I also found the collective Stack Overflow wisdom essential as ever. For Python class knowledge itself, I really liked 'Python Crash Course' by Eric Matthes. My other main resource specifically on this projects' coding was 'Mastering Blockchain - Unlocking the Power of Cryptocurrencies, Smart Contracts, and Decentralized Applications' (O'Reilly). Also I found helpful the 101Blockchains [Cheat Sheet](https://101blockchains.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Blockchian_Cheat_Sheet_pdf.pdf) as well as the one from [Intelliplaat](https://intellipaat.com/blog/tutorial/blockchain-tutorial/blockchain-cheat-sheet/). The [crash course](http://adilmoujahid.com/posts/2018/03/intro-blockchain-bitcoin-python/) on Adil Moujahid's page was great.
